<P>

This article will assist you in determining your speed (MPH) for a given RPM or the RPM for a given speed and a selected gear (1 through 4) for the
Commando (AMC) gearbox.
<p>

<b>The Commando gearbox ratios are :</b>
<ul>
<li>1st gear is 2.56 to 1
<li>2nd gear is 1.70 to 1
<li>3rd gear is 1.21 to 1
<li>4th gear is 1 to 1
</ul>
<p>

It is easiest to start the calculations for fourth gear since it is a 1 to 1 ratio.
At the end of this article we will show how to calculate the speed for the other gears.
If you are using this article to calculate the speed for a gearbox that does not have a gear ratio of 1 to 1, assume the 1 to 1 ratio
and convert to your actual ratios as we do for the other Commando gears. 
<p>

<b>Nomenclature :</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>ES -- The engine sprocket, in teeth (normally part # 06-4681, 26T).
<li>CS -- The clutch sprocket in teeth (normally part # 06-2482, 57T).
<li>GS -- The gearbox sprocket in teeth (countershaft sprocket).
<li>RS -- The rear wheel sprocket in teeth (normally 42T for a stock Commando).
<li>WD -- The rear wheel diameter in inches (not the rim size, but with tire mounted).
<li>P -- The value for Pie (3.1416).
<li>RPM -- Engine Revolutions per Minute.
<li>MPH -- Miles Per Hour.
<li>Constants in the first formula -- 12 (to convert inches to feet), 60 (to convert minutes to hours), 5280 (to convert feet to miles).
</ul>
<p>

<b>The formula :</b>
<p>
<b>MPH = ES/CS x GS/RS x (P x WD)/12 x (RPM x 60)/5280</b><br>
Or simplified some :<br>
<b>MPH = ES/CS x GS/RS x (P x WD x 60)/63360 x RPM</b>
<p>

<b>Examples :</b>
<p>
ES = 26 and CS = 57 or 26/57 = .4561<br>
GS = 19 and RS = 42 or 19/42 = .4524<br>
WD = 25.5” so (3.1416 x 25.5 x 60)/ 63360 =.0759<br>
.Therefore at 7000 rpm .4561 x .4524 x .0759 x 7000 = 109.63mph 
<p>

If you just chance the GS from 19T to 20T, at 7000rpm your speed would be :<br>
.4561 x 20/42 x .0759 x 7000 = 115.40mph
<p>

Setting the RPM at constant 6500 and WD at 25.5” you can calculate a constant for [(P x WD x 60)/63360 x RPM] of 493.35:
<bp>
Leaving the ES at 26 and the CS at 57 we further simplify the formula to :<br>
<b>MPH = .4561 x GS/RS x 225.02 or MPH = GS/RS x 225.02</b><br>
By changing your gearbox or rear sprocket, you can calculate what your speed will be at 6500rpm.
<p>

On the other hand, if you want find the RPM at 65mph for a particular gearbox sprocket the formula would be:<br>
<b>RPM = MPH / (ES/CS x GS/RS x (P x WD x 60)/63360)</b><br>
Leaving everything the same as in the first example and we want to cruse at 65mph our formula is :<br>
RPM = 65 / (.4561 x .4524 x .0759) = 4,140rpm<br>
a 20T gearbox sprocket drops our RPM to 3,939rpm.
<p>

You can calculate the speeds at each gear by dividing the 4th speed by the gear ratio.
<p>
Taking the first answer of 109.63 at 7000rpm, that gearing would produce a top speed in 1st gear at 7000 (109.63 / 2.56) of 42.82mph.
<p>
The gearing in the second example or 115.40mph at 7000rpm will give at 7000rpm the following:<br>
1st -- 2.56 to 1 = 45.08mph<br>
2nd -- 1.70 to 1 = 67.88mph<br>
3rd -- 1.21 to 1 = 95.37mph<br>
4th -- 1.00 to 1 = 115.40mph<br>
