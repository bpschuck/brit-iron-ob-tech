I do not lace up wheels, but send them off to the experts at Buchanan's in California (626) 969-4655,
so I do not have the practical knowledge that comes from actually lacing up lots of wheel, but I will list what I do know about Commando
wheel lacing and show pictures of properly laced wheels.

The front disc rim to hub offset is approximately 1.4".  The hub is approximately
4.5" wide and the edges of the rim are the same distance from both ends of the hub.  For the WM3 shouldered Excel rim, .3" of the hub sticks
out past the outside edge of the rim on both sides.  
We will be calling the center of the hub the center between the two spoke flanges, not the center between the two ends.
The distance of the disc side of the hub to the center of the hub is approximately 2.95", where the distance from the non-disc
side of the hub to the center is 1.55".  This means that the center of the hub is moved in the non-disc direction 1.4".
<P>
You will also notice that on both sides the spokes cross over three spokes going in the other direction on the same spoke flange.

Your will notice that the disc side spokes cross over three spokes going in the other direction on the same spoke flange, but the
non-disc side only crosses over two spokes.

The early Commando non-cush-drive rear drum hub is offset about 1/8" to the right and the later Commando cush-drive hub is offset about 3/16"
to the right.
You will also notice that on both sides the spokes cross over two spokes going in the other direction on the same spoke flange.
