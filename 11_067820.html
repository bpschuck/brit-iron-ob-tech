<p>
The tappets are located in the lower part of the Cylinder Barrel retained by Four 2BA screws,
two screws to each plate, passing through a separating plate for each tappet.
<p>
Current prices are:<br>
Tappets (part # 06-7820)
<!-- PRICE(11-067820) -->
$400.00 
a set.<br>
2BA screws (part # 06-7560)
<!-- PRICE(11-067560) -->
$5.60 
each.<br>
Separating plate (part # 06-3092)
<!-- PRICE(11-063092) -->
$15.85 
each.
<p>

To remove the tappets cut the safety wire for the plate retaining screws (06-7560)
and remove the screws.
<p>
The tappets are machined in pairs and must be re-fitted in the same order as they were removed.  <b>They do not interchange</b>
<p>
It is most important, when re-fitting the tappets: to apply a little clean oil and ensure the
beveled edges are side by side facing the front of the engine.
Inadvertent reversal will restrict oil drainage and also prevent lubrication.
<p>
Firmly tighten the plate retaining screws and secure with safety wire linking the two screws
<p>

The standard tappet diameter is 1.1865" to 1.1875".<br>
The +.020 tappet (part # 06-7820/020,
<!-- PRICE(11-067820/020) -->
$188.93)
diameter is 1.2065" to 1.2075".<br>
The clearance between the tappets and the cylinder bore is 0.0010" to 0.0015".
