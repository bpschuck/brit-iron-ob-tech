Files from the Old Brits Technical Articles (Norton related)

On the brit-iron-l@list.indiana.edu email list, it was reported that the technical articles at https://oldbritts.com/ob_main.html will dissappear when the site subscription runs out. Old Britts is/was a Norton Parts dealership run by Fred and Ella Eaton until they retired.

The files with a .archive extension were downloaded from https://web.archive.org/web/20220316000133/http://oldbritts.com/ob_tech.html. These files could not be downloaded from the Old Britts website. For those files, although a 403 or 404 not found error is not displayed, the resulting file was a zero byte file. The HTML files downloaded from Web Archive needed to be modified to remove WA site specific tagging, as well as some links to the Old Britts online store that is no longer available.
