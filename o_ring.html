<B><FONT size="5">Summary:</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT size="4">This article covers what is required to convert a Commando rear drive chain to an o-ring chain.</FONT>
<P>

<B><FONT size="5">Procedure:</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT size="4"><B>First</B>, the stock chain size for a Commando is a 530 chain which is a 5/8" x 3/8" chain.
The width of the 530 chain rivet is about .85" wide.  This chain just fits between the gearbox and the inner primary case.
An o-ring chain has two o-rings between the outer plates and the inner link, keeping dirt and grime from the inner roller.
The two o-rings make the chain about 1/8" wider than a stock chain, therefore a 530 o-ring chain will not fit between the
gearbox and the inner primary case.  I have seen a lot of Commando inner primary cases where the stock chain has rubbed against the case
when the case was not properly aligned.
<P>
In order to upgrade your Commando to an o-ring chain, you first must go down one size from a 530 to a 520 chain which is a 5/8"
x 1/4" chain.  The 520 o-ring chain is just about the same width as the stock 530 chain.
The width of the 520 chain rivet is about .85" wide.
</FONT>
<P>

<FONT size="4"><B>Second</B>, you need to change your gearbox sprocket (counter shaft sprocket) to a 520 sprocket.
Your stock 530 sprocket is too thick to fit between the links of the 520 o-ring chain.
This may be a good time to change your gearing if you are not happy with your present gearing (see chart at the end of the article for
gearing ratios and speeds/RPM).
We stock the standard size sprockets in the 520 thickness:

<!-- PRICE(12-040480/A) -->

<LI>Gearbox Sprocket, 20 Tooth, For 520 Chain, part # 06-0931/A,
<!-- PRICE(12-060931/A) -->
$61.75.
<LI>Gearbox Sprocket, 21 Tooth, For 520 Chain, part # 06-0721/A,
<!-- PRICE(12-060721/A) -->
$55.85.
<LI>Gearbox Sprocket, 22 Tooth, For 520 Chain, part # 06-0759/A,
<!-- PRICE(12-060759/A) -->

<!-- PRICE(12-063420/A) -->
$0.00.
</UL>
<P>

<FONT size="4"><B>Third</B>, you need to have your rear sprocket milled down to accept the thinner 520 o-ring chain.
We can mill down your rear sprocket or we sell new sprockets converted to the 520 thickness.
You may want to think about also modifying your rear sprocket to accept a sealed bearing.

<P>

<FONT size="4"><B>Fourth</B>, you need to select the type and length of 520 o-ring chain.
We stock two types of 520 o-ring chain, plain and gold.  The gold chain has gold links.

<P>

<FONT size="4"><B>Sixth</B>, the clearance between the countershaft sprocket and the gearbox shell is minimal at best and should be checked.
I place the chain on the bike with the master link in place (the master link is a bit fatter than the rest of the chain) and spin the chain
so the master link runs past the gearbox shell.  If the master link did not rub against the shell, you are fine.  If the master link did rub
against the shell, you will have to shim out the sprocket.  The only shims available to shim out the sprocket are (part # 06-7569,
<!-- PRICE(11-067569) -->
$2.20)
and are .003" thick.  The shim or shims will go in-between the counter shaft sprocket and the bearing spacer (04-0131).
<P>
The sleeve gear (4th gear main) fits up against the inner race of the mainshaft bearing on the inside of the gearbox and the bearing spacer
fits up against the inner race on the outside.  The shim or shims fit up against the bearing spacer and the countershaft sprocket fits up
against the shims or the bearing spacer with the sprocket nut pulling everything together.
