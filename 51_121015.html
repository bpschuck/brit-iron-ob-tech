<B>Removing the lock from the switch.</B>

The lock has a spring pin (as shown in the next picture) that fits into a recess inside the switch.
The switch has a hole in the side, corresponding to the recess that the spring pin fits into.

You will need two punches or suitable tools to remove the lock.
A 3/32" punch will fit into the hole in the side of the switch and compress the spring pin on the lock and a 1/8" punch will fit
into the hole in the end of the switch.  When you compress the spring pin, you can push the lock out of the switch, using the punch through
the end of the switch.

<B>Inserting the lock into the switch.</B>
<P>
Inserting the lock is as simple as lining up the spring pin on the lock with the hole in the side of the switch and push the lock home.

Two position master switch, part number 17-500004,
<!-- PRICE(17-500004) -->

<P>

To use the two position master switch, instead of the stock switch and lock, all you have to do is connect the wire from pin 1 (Brown/ Blue wire) to <B>BAT</B> screw
and all the other three wires to the <B>COIL</B> screw.
<P>
You can wire the three position master switch as the two position switch and if for some reason you only want to turn on some functions, you can use the <B>ACC</B> screw.
If you want to allow the engine to be started and only the brake light, turn signals and horn to operate, you connect the white wire to the <B>ACC</B> screw.
